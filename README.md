# Why I made this ruleset:
I want to start by saying I don't have an issue with Super Kaizo IronMON. In fact, I have 3500 super runs and 5000 subpar (modified super rules by Arex) attempts. However, after going back and defeating normal Kaizo at 9400 attempts, I really craved a ruleset that leaned
more towards normal kaizo while still enforcing the Safari Zone pivot. It currently feels like all or nothing in terms of rules for FR/LG Kaizo, and I want to create a ruleset that lands somewhere in the middle. At the end of the day, this is all about having a fun 
challenge, and I'd like a challenge more in line with normal Kaizo IronMON. 


# General Rules for All Games
0. ALL PREVIOUS [Standard, Ultimate, and Kaizo](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) rules apply (unless overridden by any rules below)!
1. ~Every Trainer has SMART AI, this requires a ROM patch~ **(This challenge will take place in normal Kaizo Ironmon. No SMART AI patch is needed)**
2. ~Every Trainer from lvl 35 and up have Sensible held items which include berries AND stat/type-enhancing held-items.~
3. Safari Zone Pivot: You must pivot to a NEW Pokémon about midway through the game, before beating the game:
     - See Game Specific Rules for when this must be done, usually after the 4th Gym and/or in the Safari Zone
     - Only Pokémon that have defeated a Gym Leader can enter the Safari Zone, or otherwise be used for Mid-game pivoting
     - For this "pivot", you may catch 3 Pokémon and compare them. You may level, evo, teach TMs, etc. to any of the 3. You must eventually settle on using ONE of them.
     - You may catch an additional 4th Pokémon if it's one of your starter favorites.
     - Once you settle on a pivot:
          - It must be different than any Pokémon you were running before; if it later evolves into one of those Pokémon, that's OK
          - You may reenter each Dungeon one additional time
          **- You must beat the game with this new Pokémon**
4. ~All Hidden Items are banned except:~
**(ALL hidden items throughout the run are allowed.)**
5. ALL Step Items (Mt. Moon, Tunnels, etc) are now allowed but only AFTER you make your locked in Safari Zone pivot.
6. The 3 TMs in the Safari Zone are your Pivot TMs for the Safari Zone Pivot.
     - You may use any of these Pivot TMs once you make your Safari Zone Pivot.
     - You may not use these on any of the potential pivots. Only on the confirmed pivot.       
7. Additional Banned Abilities:
     - **Battle Armor / Shell Armor**
     - **Pickup** is okay except you can't use items from it (toss them)
     - **All banned abilities are allowed on Pokemon with 420 BST and below**
     - **You are allowed to use Huge/Pure Power on any Pokemon as long as you never use a Physical move. 
          - If you have Huge Power, you cannot use Metronome, Mirror Move, or Mimic if the mon is over 420 BST.
8. Unbanned Moves:
~Attacking moves with HP draining effects such as Giga Drain are legal~
     - **(Healing moves are still banned in SuperLightKaizoIronMON. Just clarifying in case of confusion)**
10. Only one HM Friend allowed prior to Mid-game pivot, to prevent unnecessarily scouting moves on all Pokémon
11. No Legendary favorites
