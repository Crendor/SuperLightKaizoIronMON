# SuperLightKaizoIronMon

This is a modified version of the Super Kaizo IronMON ruleset by iateyourpie

The original ruleset: https://github.com/PyroMikeGit/SuperKaizoIronMON

# Why I made this ruleset:
I want to start by saying I don't have an issue with Super Kaizo IronMON. In fact, I have 3500 super runs and 5000 subpar (modified super rules by Arex) attempts. However, after going back and defeating normal Kaizo at 9400 attempts, I really craved a ruleset that fell somewhere between the two versions. Trying to play Super Kaizo IronMON again made me realize - I think I just want a safari pivot within normal Kaizo ironMON. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to try it out. 


# General Rules for All Games
0. ALL PREVIOUS [Standard, Ultimate, and Kaizo](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) rules apply (unless overridden by any rules below)!
1. ~Every Trainer has SMART AI, this requires a ROM patch~ **(This challenge will take place in normal Kaizo Ironmon. No SMART AI patch is needed)**
2. ~Every Trainer from lvl 35 and up have Sensible held items which include berries AND stat/type-enhancing held-items.~
3. Safari Zone Pivot: You must pivot to a NEW Pokémon about midway through the game, before beating the game:
     - See Game Specific Rules for when this must be done, usually after the 4th Gym and/or in the Safari Zone
     - Only Pokémon that have defeated a Gym Leader can enter the Safari Zone, or otherwise be used for Mid-game pivoting
     - For this "pivot", you may catch 3 Pokémon and compare them. You may level, evo, teach TMs, etc. to any of the 3. You must eventually settle on using ONE of them.
     - You may catch an additional 4th Pokémon if it's one of your starter favorites.
     - Once you settle on a pivot:
          - It must be different than any Pokémon you were running before; if it later evolves into one of those Pokémon, that's OK
          - You may reenter each Dungeon one additional time
          **- You must beat the game with this new Pokémon**
4. The 3 TMs in the Safari Zone are your Pivot TMs for the Safari Zone Pivot.
     - You may use any of these Pivot TMs once you make your Safari Zone Pivot.       
5. Only one HM Friend allowed prior to Mid-game pivot, to prevent unnecessarily scouting moves on all Pokémon
6. No Legendary favorites
 
# Game Specific Rules
**Fire Red / Leaf Green**

0. All other [FRLG specific Kaizo rules](https://gist.github.com/UTDZac/a147c497424dfbd537d8c4b0c22b5621#fire-red--leaf-green) apply, unless changed below
1. ~Misty's Gym must be completed IMMEDIATELY after getting the Nugget from Nugget Bridge~  
2. ~Erika's Gym must be completed before entering Rocket Hideout~
3. ~No fighting trainers in S.S. Anne, except for the Rival to get Cut~  **(I thought of keeping Super pathing but decided against it. I want there to be more Safari runs, on top of sticking to the spirit of normal kaizo.)**
4. Mid-game Pivot Rules:
     - The pivot must be done in one of the Fuchsia Safari Zone areas
     - You can leave and come back if you need to check Pokémon moves outside
5. You cannot visit Sevii Islands
